Johnson Reduction Theory Detector

A lightweight experimental tool for observing unusual patterns in text, numbers, and OCR input through the lens of Johnson Reduction Theory.

---

Overview

This project provides a simple interface for exploring repeating patterns, unexpected numerical appearances, and other small anomalies. It uses two main components:

- Johnson Mode — applies reduction-based logic to highlight potential pattern behavior.
- Quantum Enhancer — increases sensitivity for subtle or low-intensity signals.

The goal isn’t strict scientific measurement, but rather a structured way to explore how certain patterns appear, shift, or behave under different inputs.

Quantum Johnson Mode Disclaimer

Johnson Mode is still in an early, experimental state. The underlying 0=1 collapse process—which attempts to resolve ambiguous or unstable pattern readings—is not fully stabilized. Because of this, users may notice:

- inconsistent or fluctuating outputs
- sudden shifts in interpretation
- stronger variations when the Quantum Enhancer is enabled

These effects are normal for the current build. Readings should be viewed as experimental indicators, not final conclusions. Future updates aim to improve stability, reduce noise, and refine the collapse behavior.
